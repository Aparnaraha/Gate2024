GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS TO READ FROM OPERARING SYSTEM NOTES

There are 3 Documents: MAIN NOTES + SHORT NOTES + EXTRA NOTES

1. Use Short Notes for Revision. There will be various pointers like (Eg---->Pg 67), They are nothing but the
pointers to the MAIN NOTES. These are standard questions. Just read the short notes, go through these 
standard questions, and done!!!
YOU DONT NEED TO REVISE MAIN NOTES IF YOU DONT HAVE TIME.

My INSIGHTS from the Previous Years + MADE EASY Test Series + some books, also added in the short notes.

YOU DONT NEED TO REFER ANYTHING ELSE. JUST DO THIS, AND AFTER THIS DO THE PREVIOUS YEAR QUESTIONS OR TEST SERIES.
